### How are the USD prices of tokens derived?
Although the swap price of each pool is determined by liquidity, Dezswap UI treats 1 axlUSDC as 1 USD and calculates the price using the swap ratio of axlUSDC to other tokens. The axlUSDC addresses for both networks are:
  | Network        | axlUSDC Address                                                        |
